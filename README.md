# Wedaj-Mood_Companion

**Wedaj -  Mood Companion**  is a Java-based chatbot designed to interact with users in a friendly, emotionally aware way. It detects simple moods like happy, sad, or angry, and responds with text and emojis to create a more human-like, engaging conversation. 

This project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including:  
-  Classes and objects  
-  Inheritance & polymorphism  
-  Encapsulation & modular design  

The chatbot will feature a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with a chat history, input field, mood indicator, and emoji-enhanced responses.  

## Planned Features

1. **Core Structure**: `ChatBot` class with `Memory` and `ResponseGenerator` components  
2. **Mood Detection**: Simple keyword-based mood analysis with pre-defined responses  
3. **Memory Feature**: Store and recall basic user information  
4. **GUI Integration**: Interactive chat interface triggering OOP methods
